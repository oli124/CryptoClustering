# CryptoClustering
Module 19 Challenge

In this project we will use unsupervised learning methods to analyse returns of a variety crypto currencies over different time periods.

Overview of Analysis Process:
- Firstly, we will run the analysis using the original data (albeit scaled) and show the results visually, using a scatter plot
- Following this, we will perform principal component analysis on the data and then run the analysis, again showing the results visually using a scatter plot.
- Lastly, we will compare the outputs of both methods of analysis and note any observations.
- All analysis and results can be seen in the following notebook: 'Crypto_Clustering.ipynb'

GitHub Repository:
- 'Resources/crypto_market_data.csv': csv file containing returns data for a range of crypto currencies over various time periods.
- 'Crypto_Clustering.ipynb': jupyter notebook containing script that performs analysis and displays results (plots).
- 'README.md': This file, overviewing the project undertaken
- Repository URL: https://github.com/oli124/CryptoClustering.git

Except for the code provided in the 'Crypto_Clustering_starter_code.ipynb', all code is original and created by myself, Oliver King. UWA Data Analytics Bootcamp curriculum content has been reviewed during the completion of this project.
